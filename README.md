Mycelium Matrixes

This is a temporary landing page for my arts-based research project exploring the fascinating world of mycelium.

This website will eventually showcase the various aspects of my research, including:

* Artistic explorations inspired by mycelial networks and growth.
* Research findings on the unique properties and potential of mycelium.
* Documentation of experiments and creative processes.
* Potentially links to publications, exhibitions, and other related content.

**Current Status:**

This is a very early stage of the website. The content is currently limited to a basic HTML page (`myco.html`).
